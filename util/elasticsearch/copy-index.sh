# Thin wrapper around logstash. You will first have to install logstash. Simply
# downloading the tar.gz from their site is sufficient. Note that logstash may have
# different JVM version requiements than what is available on your machine.

# Copies an index from an elasticsearch source server to a target server. 
# The target server can be the same as the source.
#
# Usage:
#   copy-index.sh SOURCE_SERVER SOURCE_INDEX TARGET_SERVER TARGET_INDEX [WORKERS]
#
# Example:
#   ./copy-index.sh http://localhost:9200 source_index http://localhost:9200 target_index
